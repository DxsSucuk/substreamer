/**
 * `awaitKvHydration` — the boot gate that holds the startup chain until every
 * async-persisted startup store has loaded. Driven through a REAL store's real
 * `persist` API rather than a stub, because the whole point is the timing:
 * `rehydrate()` flips `hasHydrated` false synchronously and resolves a microtask
 * later, which is the window the gate exists to cover.
