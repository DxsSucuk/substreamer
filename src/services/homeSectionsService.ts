/**
 * Home album-list composition — the single source of truth for WHICH album
 * lists appear on the Home surface, in what order, and how they're filtered.
 * Shared by the Home screen (`src/screens/home.tsx`) and the CarPlay / Android
 * Auto browse tree (`headlessMediaService`) so both agree exactly, especially offline.
 *
 * Rules (mirrors the historical inline `home.tsx` logic):
 * - Online, unfiltered: Recently Added / Recently Played / Frequently Played /
 *   Random, in that order.
 * - `downloadedOnly`: prepend a **Downloaded Albums** list (every downloaded
 *   album) and filter each list to downloaded albums.
 * - `favoritesOnly`: filter each list to starred albums.
 * - `offlineMode`: drop **Random** (it's never meaningful offline).
 *
 * This selector only ORDERS + FILTERS the lists; it does NOT drop empty lists —
 * consumers decide empty-handling (the Home screen shows a placeholder for
 * Downloaded Albums but hides other empty lists when filtered; the car omits
 * empty rows).
